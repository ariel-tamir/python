Read commands from file input.txt.
The commands update the count of words.
The possible commands are:
ADD <word>
REMOVE <word>

And print the count of each word, whose count is bigger than zero.
The list printed should be sorted alphabetically.
For example:

ADD aa
ADD bb
ADD aa
ADD cc
REMOVE cc
ADD bb
REMOVE aa

output:
aa 1
bb 2
