create a game.
your program generates a random word.
The player tries to guess the word, and the program provides hints.


For next time:
1. If the guess is the prefix of the word, give hint.
2. Print how many guess


For example:
(This is not printed, the program generated the word az)

Enter your guess: bla
Wrong, your guess is too high

Enter your guess: a
Wrong, your guess is too low
This is a good prefix!

Enter your guess: aaaab
Wrong, your guess is too low

Enter your guess: app
Wrong, your guess is too low

Enter your guess: az
Correct!!! You Win!!!
Total of 5 guesses.
