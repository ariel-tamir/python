Create a program that asks the user for a file name.
Read the lines of the file.
If the line contains a number, the program prints the line.
After reading all the lines, print the amount of lines with numbers, the amount of lines without numbers, and the total amount of lines.
For example:

If we have file input.txt with the following content:

I ate 3 bananas.
But then I saw bruno.
He told me he can see my future.
He was holding 1 crystal ball.
I saw his vision.
In the vision I ate 3 bananas, and my stomach ached.
The end!


Enter file name: input.txt

I ate 3 bananas.
He was holding 1 crystal ball.
In the vision I ate 3 bananas, and my stomach ached.

The file has 7 lines, 3 of them with numbers, and 4 without numbers.
