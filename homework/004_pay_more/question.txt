Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
Give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
Handle non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program.

Examples:

Enter Hours: 45
Enter Rate: 10
Pay: 475.0

Enter Hours: 20
Enter Rate: nine
Error, please enter numeric input

Enter Hours: forty
Error, please enter numeric input
