Mirabel Madrigal is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 60th feature, Encanto (2021). Mirabel is depicted as an imperfect and quirky but emotional and empathetic 15-year-old[1] girl who is the only member of the Madrigal family to not receive a magical gift. When their "miracle" begins to fade, she takes it upon herself to save the magic, learning of her familial troubles along the way.

From the beginning of development, Mirabel was conceived as the only member of her family without a gift. Although the plot initially depicted her desperately searching for a gift, her motivation was adjusted to a desire to be noticed, which was deemed more relatable towards the audience. Based on the appearance of tourist guide Alejandra Espinosa Uribe, Mirabel's design began with her skirt, which features much embroidery that represents her personality. American actress Stephanie Beatriz provides her voice; after first auditioning for the role of Luisa, Beatriz was deemed perfect for Mirabel.

Critics praised the character, as well as Beatriz's performance; Mirabel has also been discussed among therapists and has received multiple awards.

Development
Conception
Directors Byron Howard and Jared Bush revealed that after finishing Zootopia (2016), they knew they wanted their next project to be a musical[2]—which turned into a Latin American musical after Lin-Manuel Miranda came on board.[3] They discussed their common experience of having large extended families, and decided to make a musical film about a large extended family with a dozen main characters.[4] Howard and Bush started to discuss Latin American culture at length with Juan Rendon and Natalie Osma, who had previously worked with them on the making-of documentary Imagining Zootopia.[2] Rendon and Osma both happened to be from Colombia and repeatedly drew upon their personal experiences with Colombian culture in their discussions, which caused Howard, Bush, and Miranda to focus their research on that country.[2] Rendon and Osma became the first two of several cultural experts hired by Disney Animation as consultants on the film,[2] who collectively formed what Disney called the "Colombian Cultural Trust."[5]

The Encanto production team had finalized in the basic idea of a girl who was the only one in her family without a supernatural gift from the beginning of development. When the group began developing the characters, including Mirabel, they realized how vulnerable her position was. Co-director and screenwriter Charise Castro Smith explained Mirabel's position is "complicated and awkward and just utterly human and relatable thing [in] that [she] feel[s] like [she is] kind of the unspecial one amongst everyone else who's special and perfect and has it all figured out".[6] Mirabel's lack of powers quickly established her as the ideal plot device to the crew, as well as a sympathetic character for the audience. The reason behind her lack of powers is not explained in the film, which was intentional. Bush and Howard said that as a magic realism film, Encanto is meant to "function just as well as a story" in the absence of magic. As a result, Mirabel saves her family by resolving tensions, instead of a magical method.[7] The animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines; she had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy.[8]

Mirabel's original name was Beatriz. It was altered to her eventual name two years before casting her voice actress, Stephanie Beatriz,[9] and originated from the word "Mira", which means "to look" in Spanish.[10][11] According to Bush: "in the early days we always question if we have the right names – 'miracle' etymology and rhyme with Mirabel reinforced it."[11] Additionally, the character's name is a Latin word that means "wonderful", which represents her curiosity.[12]

As Encanto's story evolved, the writers and story artists considered her motives and imperfections. The film's plot initially depicted her desperately searching for a gift. However, the crew realized that she would have grown past this. Bush stated that her motivation to be noticed, instead of an adventure for a magical gift, felt considerably more relatable. In addition, the plot and family connections were eventually produced around this motive.[13] One version featured Mirabel narrating until the start of third act where Abuela Alma's point of view would be shown. This concept was ultimately dropped as it was regarded as too distracting.[14]

Stephanie Beatriz, the voice of Mirabel
Beatriz described herself as a "huge Disney fan". As a child, she watched many Disney films on VHS tapes. Beatriz "lost [her] mind" when she learned that Disney was creating a film set in Colombia and that Lin-Manuel Miranda was composing the soundtrack for it. Instantly, she began emailing her agents and managers, requesting an audition for the film.[6] Beatriz initially auditioned for Luisa. However, the production crew knew she was perfect for Mirabel as soon as they heard her read as the character. According to Smith, she secured the part because of her personality, humor, and distinctive voice.[15] During her audition for Mirabel, Beatriz sang "You're Welcome" from Moana and performed the scene in which Mirabel comforts Antonio before he receives his gift.[9] Beatriz called the audition a "dream come true" and booking the role her number one accomplishment.[6]

The directors wanted to let the actors explore the roles by themselves, and feel at ease "messing around and improvising in the moment".[16] Beatriz initially believed Mirabel should sound younger, so she voiced her with a higher pitch. However, Howard and Bush insisted on making her sound more mature. They considered how she had to take care of herself most of the time, because her family is full of "stars". According to Beatriz, Mirabel must manage her own needs, and this requires a certain amount of maturity.[17] Beatriz cited finding time to breathe while singing as the most challenging part of voicing Mirabel: "You got to literally plan out 'Okay. On this eighth note or whatever I've got to...' So that I'm ready for the next big chunk of it."[18] When recording Mirabel's "I Want" song, "Waiting on a Miracle", Beatriz was nine months pregnant, and worked with a vocal coach to learn proper breathing techniques and ensure that she was supporting herself properly.[19] Much of her voice work was recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sometimes, she acted with only Miranda or the directors; other days, many other crew members would listen to her. As she recorded for Mirabel, Beatriz received many sketches, which she described as "really special" as the character bore resemblance to her at the same age. For "What Else Can I Do?", she watched the sequence's initial animation, which she credited to finding a way to for her to "weave [her] way through the song using [her] voice".[20]

Design
While researching the film in Barichara, Howard and Bush befriended a local tourist guide, Alejandra Espinosa Uribe, who showed them around the town, and later hired her to consult on the film's historical and cultural authenticity.[21] Espinosa Uribe was an influence for several aspects of Mirabel, including her curly black hair, large eyeglasses, and gestures.[21] Velasquez and Xinmin Zhao, a character technical director, looked for real-life references across "the whole studio" for Mirabel's hair; they were inspired by Smith's curls.[22] The animators took inspiration from Beatriz's charactestics and mannerisms to make Mirabel as distinct as possible.[23] Mirabel's clothes are meant to look handmade.[24] As the odd one out in her family, Mirabel lacks a color palette that connects her to the Casita. Mirabel's outfit instead incorporates nearly all of her family's colors.[8]

Since Encanto is set in the Andean region, the traditional fashions of that region were a particularly important inspiration for the film's costumes. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, women from the region would normally be dressed in white tops with needlework, long skirts, and matching petticoats. They would also wear alpargatas (traditional Colombian shoes) created from fique.[25] Design work was not linear, in the sense that Disney artists repeatedly moved back and forth between different stages to iteratively improve on the character. For example, the modelers sent the production team a work-in-progress model after building a first iteration based on visual development artists' drawings of Mirabel. The artists would make draw-overs to give feedback to the modelers, adding to her anatomy and design.[26] Initial designs featured Mirabel in an oversized coat, an idea the production crew explored for some time.[27] Earlier versions of Mirabel's body shape were more stylized. When Abuela Alma's body was revised to a more naturalistic shape, Mirabel's body was also revised in the same direction as well, which meant the shape of Mirabel's neckline more closely approximated real-life human anatomy.[28]

Mirabel's design began with her skirt, which is inspired by skirts from the Vélez area as well as Colombian traditional skirts in general.[21][29] It was decorated with embroidery that was meant to seem imperfect and handcrafted. Look development artist Jose Luis "Weecho" Velasquez "virtually stitched all the embroidery by hand" on a computer to build the texture of Mirabel's skirt.[22] Disney artists designed different symbols for the skirt to exemplify each member of her family, representing her affection for them.[29] These include a candle for Alma, animals for Antonio, flowers for Isabela, a sun for Pepa, and a chameleon for Camilo.[30] The incorporation of her family's gifts on her skirt, according to Screen Rant, also displays her Madrigal pride and quickly indicates what type of character she is, not being resentful or envious of her family and actively supporting them in their gifts. Additionally, her full name is sewn on the skirt, as well as her own face wearing her glasses, as a manner of demonstrating that she lacks a gift.[31] "Loud" aspects, such as pink tassels, are also depicted to represent her desire to be noticed.[32] According to associate production designer Lorelay Bové, her skirt is similar to "a 15-year-old girl's scrapbook".[29] Mirabel's shirt has a butterfly pattern that references the Madrigal family. Butterfly designs are seen throughout the Casita, with the candle having one as well. This is in accordance with the film's overall theme of significant transformations.[30]

Mirabel is the first Disney heroine to wear glasses.[33] They are a significant part of her appearance. A primary theme of the film, according to Bové, is perspective and their protagonist's glasses was a deliberate choice to highlight that concept.[29] Bush stated this was because one of the adventures she embarks on is to see her family in a new light and people for who they are: "we gave her glasses on purpose because it was a part of her journey and we wanted it to be baked into her character."[34] Another reason she wears them is because part of her name comes from the Spanish word "Mira", which means "to look".[10] Their green color is a reference to Bruno, her uncle, who wears green clothing.[35]

Appearances
Encanto
Main article: Encanto (film)
At age five, Mirabel is denied a gift from her family's miracle.[a] From this point onwards, everyone's expectations of her change and everyone, including Mirabel herself, sees her differently.[36] Ten years later, she is accidentally left out of a family picture and feels she is not truly a part of the Madrigal family.[37] As she wishes to have a gift, Mirabel notices Casita cracking and the candle[b] flickering, which Alma, her abuela, says would never happen. Mirabel warns everyone, but the cracks disappear and no one believes her. As she hears Alma questioning whether the miracle is dying, she takes it upon herself to save it.

Luisa, her older sister, suggests Mirabel search her missing uncle Bruno's room for a clue, as it is rumored he had a vision about the magic. Mirabel finds the vision and sees herself surrounded by a cracked Casita, implying she might be the cause of the miracle dying; Dolores later reveals the secret to everyone. Meanwhile, Mirabel finds Bruno hiding inside the house's walls. She questions him about his vision, but he says he only knows that the fate of the Madrigal family will come down to her. When he makes another vision, Mirabel sees a butterfly and herself hugging someone, who she and Bruno identify as Isabela, her eldest sister. Annoyed due to Isabela's entitled personality, Mirabel insincerely asks her for a hug, which she refuses. Isabela inadvertently reveals she struggles with the constant pressure to be perfect and that she never wanted to marry Mariano. Mirabel convinces Isabela to become more imperfect and true to herself, and they reconcile, partially healing the cracks near the candle. Alma sees them and accuses Mirabel of trying to hurt the family out of spite for not having a gift. Finally fed up with this treatment, Mirabel angrily snaps at Alma for always seeing her as a disappointment and that she, along with the rest of the family, will never be good enough for her, no matter how hard they try and that the miracle is dying because of her. The house breaks and collapses as a result of their heated argument, and despite Mirabel's attempt to save the candle, it extinguishes in her hands. Distraught and heartbroken, Mirabel runs away.

At the river where her husband, Pedro, died, Alma finds Mirabel and apologizes for her accusation and expecting too much from their family. Mirabel and Alma reconcile.[38] They return to a broken Casita; Mirabel encourages her family they are more than their gift, while Alma apologizes for recognizing her family's powers as the miracle, instead of their existence. They, with the townspeople, rebuild the Casita. The Madrigals make a doorknob with an "M" on it for Mirabel to place into the front door, causing Casita to be restored again, and the family regains their powers. Later, they take a group photo together, this time with Mirabel at the center of her family.

Merchandise
By December 2021, Disney released the Mirabel Singing Doll on shopDisney. The doll sings "The Family Madrigal" from the film. The Mirabel Singing Large Doll, by Jakks Pacific, says more than 15 phrases inspired by Encanto.[39] Funko Pop released a set of 4-inch, vinyl figurines of members of the Madrigal family, including Mirabel, in January 2022.[40]

Disney Parks
From November 2021 Mirabel started making appearances in the Disney Parks for meet and greets in the Adventureland area of the parks.[41][42]

Reception
Mirabel has been praised by film critics. San Francisco Chronicle's G. Allen Johnson argued, "Perhaps Mirabel, one of Disney's most engaging creations, has the greatest superpower of them all."[43] Screen Daily expressed "Mirabel exudes a warm energy, looking after her younger cousins and serving as the emotional glue for her family. But there's also a little insecurity in there as well, as the filmmakers illustrate that Mirabel is compensating for her lack of powers – she's so helpful and friendly".[44] Critics have found Beatriz magnificent,[45] terrific,[46] perfectly cast,[47] spectacular,[48] excellent,[49] spirited,[50] and exceptional.[51] IGN asserted Beatriz "brings just the right amount of charm and sincerity to the non-magical teenager".[52]

Since its release, Encanto has been discussed among therapists. In particular, Mirabel has been interpreted as the "[t]he healer trying to keep her family whole".[53] Psychology Today stated that despite attempting to use "positive self-talk" at the start of the film, Mirabel's sense of self-worth and belonging is harmed by her lack of powers. The website interpreted how Alma later understood that Mirabel's existence is a gift as a message of self-appreciation.[54] According to USA Today, Mirabel does what many Latino millennials seeking to end generational trauma want to do: confront the source of the problem, to the person(s) who is/are causing the pain.[55]

Accolades
Mirabel won Best Animated Female at the 2022 Alliance of Women Film Journalists Awards and 2021 Women Film Critics Circle Awards,[56][57][58] in addition to the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Animated Character in an Animated Feature.[59] Beatriz has also received various nominations for her voice performance, including the Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement for Voice Acting in a Feature Production.[60]

Notes
 Gifted to the Madrigal family after Pedro Madrigal sacrificed himself to save his wife and children. At age five, Madrigal descendants are gifted with a magical power that they use to serve their village.
 The candle is from Alma and Pedro's wedding. When they are forced by an armed conflict to flee their village in Colombia, Pedro takes the candle but dies. By a miracle the candle attains magical qualities, including being able to never go out, blasts away the pursuers, and creates a sentient house, the Casita, for them to live in, along with a magical realm bordered by tall surrounding mountains—an encanto. Fifty years later, the candle continues to burn and a town thrives under its protection.
